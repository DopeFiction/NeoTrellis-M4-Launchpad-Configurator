## Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 Launchpad Configurator

This project intends to provide a tool that makes it easier to configure your Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 as a launchpad device such as the one in the guide.

It is implemented as an HTML5 web application that you can run locally, or host on a server is you wish. The application provides a nice easy to use GUI for editing the configuration of the launchpad.

As you can see in the guide the main configuration is controlled by a python dictionary variable named `keymap`. This web application allows you to import the python keymap dictionary, then make changes to colors and keys pressed, you can even add comments if you want. 

Once you're happy with the configuration use the export button to get an updated copy of the python dictionary ready to be pasted into your code.py file.
